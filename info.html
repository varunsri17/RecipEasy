                Imagine this scenario: it’s been a busy week, and you haven’t
                had much time to meal prep or go grocery shopping. You don’t
                have enough money to afford UberEats for a third time this week.
                But, you have a potpourri of leftover ingredients that you don’t
                know what to do with. Moreso, you don’t know what you can really
                make with those ingredients. RecipEasy will solve this problem
                by allowing users to easily find recipes with whatever
                ingredients that you have. We would like to empower YOU to be
                more effective and efficient home cooks!

                How to Stay Healthy During Covid-19
              </h5>
              <p>
                COVID-19 is the perfect time to work on improving your health
                choices with the ingredients you have. While using our app, we
                hope you take care to include all major food groups into your
                diet, paying attention to the food pyramid. Make sure to get at
                least 70 grams of protein, 50 grams of carbohydrates, and 20
                grams of fat. We will help you create these healthy options, so
                you can live a happy, healthy, and energetic life!
