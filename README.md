What is RecipEasy?
Well, imagine this scenario: it’s been a busy week, and you haven’t had much time to meal prep or go grocery shopping. 
You don’t have enough money to afford UberEats for a third time this week.
But, you have a potpourri of leftover ingredients that you don’t know what to do with. 
Moreso, you don’t know what you can really make with those ingredients. 
RecipEasy will solve this problem by allowing users to easily find recipes with whatever ingredients that you have. 
We would like to empower YOU to be more effective and efficient home cooks!
